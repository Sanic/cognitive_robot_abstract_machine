"""
Common Analysis Structure (CAS) for RoboKudo.

This module provides the core data structure used throughout RoboKudo for storing
and managing data during pipeline execution. The CAS (Common Analysis Structure)
holds sensor data, annotations, and other information that is shared between
annotators.

The module provides:

* Standard view definitions for common data types
* Methods for storing and retrieving data
* Support for annotations and filtering
* Timestamp management
